# ML-for-ILS
The repository contains the obtained jupyter files used to predict the density/sound velocity of ionic liquids using machine learning methods.
<h1<Description of methods: </h1>
The files are all similar, they just use different machine learning methods. The architecture of the files is less complicated than that of a neural network.
The catalog also includes sample plots of experimental data vs. method predictions.
